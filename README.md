# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Expected credit loss (ECL) computation is a method used in credit risk management to determine the amount of loss a bank is expected to incur in the event a borrower defaults on their loan. Different banks may use different methodologies for calculating the expected credit loss (ECL)

ECLs are calculated based on the exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) for each borrower. Banks can calculate the ECL for different points in time based on their risk management strategy and regulatory requirements.

# Problem Statement

Focus on the Loss Given Default (LGD) component of the ECL computation. The objective is to build a statistical model to estimate borrowersâ€™ LGD.
